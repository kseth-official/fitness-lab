# FitnessLab – Your Personal Gym Management Solution 💪

Hello, I'd like to introduce you to FitnessLab, a passion project turned reality that brings gym management to a whole new level.

## 🏋️‍♂️ What I've Built:
FitnessLab is a Java Desktop Application that started as a project from my databases class at university that I have refined and expanded to make better. I have crafted a gym management software with a feature set to transform fitness centers' operations.

## 🧩 Key Features:

- ER Diagram Wizardry: I personally designed an ER diagram with 9 entities, 11 relationships, and 2 ISA hierarchies. This isn't just about structure but efficiency and eliminating data redundancy.
- Rock-Solid Backend: I used JDBC/Oracle to implement our database, complete with a slick SQL Plus script for quick setup. Dynamic SQL queries and robust error handling are the backbone of our system.
- User-Friendly Frontend: The Java Swing framework was my canvas, creating a sleek and intuitive interface connecting users to their data.

## 🔧 My Skills in Action:
- Java: The heart and soul of FitnessLab.
- SQL Plus: Crafting scripts for a finely tuned database.
- Oracle DB: Our data's sanctuary.
- JDBC: Bridging the gap between Java and Oracle.
- Swing: Making the frontend as smooth as your workout routine.
- ER Diagrams, Normalization, BCNF: Ensuring data integrity and efficiency.

FitnessLab isn't just software; it reflects my commitment to excellence in software engineering. Join me on this journey to transform gym management, one fitness center at a time. Let's make managing fitness centers a breeze together! 💼🚀
