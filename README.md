# FitnessLab\

Hello, I'd like to introduce you to FitnessLab, a passion project turned reality that brings gym management to a whole new level.

## What I've Built:
FitnessLab is a Java Desktop Application that started as a project from my databases class at university that I have refined and expanded to make better. I have crafted a gym management software with a feature set to transform fitness centers' operations.

## Key Features:

- ER Diagram: I personally designed an ER diagram with 9 entities, 11 relationships, and 2 ISA hierarchies. This isn't just about structure but efficiency and eliminating data redundancy.
- Backend: I used JDBC/Oracle to implement our database, complete with a slick SQL Plus script for quick setup. Dynamic SQL queries and robust error handling are the backbone of our system.
- Frontend: The Java Swing framework was my canvas, creating a sleek and intuitive interface connecting users to their data.

## Skills:
